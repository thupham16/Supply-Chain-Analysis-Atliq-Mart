# Problem and Business Requirements
## Problem
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues.
- Speculated issue: Essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period

## Business Requirement
Management wants to fix this by tracking the ‘On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all customers daily basis.
- Metrics on daily basis and vs target, split by cities and customers
- Matrix visual for Customer and All the metric – apply conditional formatting based on gap vs target
- KPI performance vs Target over Month – drillable for weeks an days
- KPI for products in details

## Business - related term
- On time (OT %) = Number of orders delivered On Time / Total Number of Orders
- In full (IF%) = Number of Orders delivered in Full Quantity/ Total Number of Orders
- On Time in Full (OTIF %) = Number of Orders delivered both IN full & On Time/ Total Number of Orders
-	Line fill rate (LIFR%) = number of order lines shipped in Full quantity/ total order lines
